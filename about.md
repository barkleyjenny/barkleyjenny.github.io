I am a cpg operator with a bent on building connection through the foods we eat and the products we use. Based in the Rocky Mountains, I travel 90% of the time because I love to solve problems in person.

**I work with brands in the 3 following ways:**

1. Develop partnerships with suppliers, manufacturers and logistics providers whose interests align with a brand's goal to transform how we produce and consume

2. Research ingredients, markets and technologies to develop businesses that drive that transformation

3. Lead transparency initiatives that tell a story that connects the community a brand seres with the impact a brand makes


# Let's build something great!
