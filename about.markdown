#Leadership
Barkley is an experienced operator with a singular conviction: anything is possible.

#The approach:
**Data:** clear metrics unite teams and lead to faster and better decision making. Data is also a great negotiator–a storyteller that brings the biggest partners to the table.

**Partners:** developing strategic partnerships with suppliers and manufacturers whose interests align with a brand’s core identity. This means the right partners with the right processes to create long term value.

**Transparency:** great brands do things differently. Let’s show our people how, and let’s start that story at the farm, the forest, the fishery.
